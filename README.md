# Introduction
These are my personal development scripts for setting local per-project vim
options and ignoring vim files in git. If you find them useful, feel free to
steal them and tweak them for your own preferences.

## Usage
To install the scripts do:

```
$ ./setup.sh
```

For the specific `*.vimrc.local` scripts for specific projects, you will need
to copy them into the project root as `.vimrc.local`.
